== Camel K Log Analyser

This is a Camel K-based log analyser which listens to both a rest
endpoint and TCP endpoint.

=== Requirements

To run this code, you will need:

Camel K Operator: Red Hat Integration - Camel K Camel K CLI - Install
Camel K CLI by following the instructions on the official CamelK website
(https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.11.x/cli/cli.html). Ensure the
version of Camel K used in the operator and the CLI match, the Red Hat
Integration - Camel K Operator uses 1.8.2
(https://camel.apache.org/releases/k-1.8.2/) as of 02/23.

=== Usage

This code sets up a REST endpoint at /log-aggregator that accepts POST
requests. The message body of the request will be logged using Camelâ€™s
logging feature. Additionally, this code sets up a Netty TCP endpoint at
0.0.0.0:8008 that will log any incoming messages.

=== How to Deploy

Login to OCP: `+oc login --token=myToken --server=myServerUrl+`

Deploy using Camel K CLI: `+kamel run LogAnalyser.java+`

Once deployed, you can send a POST request to the /log-aggregator
endpoint with a message body to see the message logged. You can also
send a message to the Netty TCP endpoint to see the message logged.
